## Allow generating placeholder without VIASH START/VIASH END blocks.

A script does not need to contain a `VIASH START`/`VIASH END` block in order to function.

Previously, each script had to contain a codeblock as follows:

```r
## VIASH START
par <- list(
  input = "foo",
  output = "bar
)
## VIASH END
```

This codeblock would be replaced by viash with a list containing the command-line arguments.

## Bug fixes

* BUG FIX `viash ns build`: Some platforms would sometimes not be detected.

* BUG FIX `viash run`: Avoid error when no arguments need to be chowned.
