  - MAJOR CHANGES: Refactoring of the Functionality class as discussed
    in VIP1 (\#1). This has resulted in a lot of internal changes, but
    the changes with regard to the yaml definitions are relatively
    minor. See the section below for more info.
  - MINOR CHANGES: Updated the functionality.yamls under `atoms/` and
    `src/test/` to reflect these aforementioned changes.
  - BUG FIX: Do not quote passthrough flags.
  - BUG FIX: Allow for spaces inside of Docker volume paths.
  - DOCUMENTATION: Updated the README.md.
  - DOCUMENTATION: Provide some small examples at `doc/examples`.
  - MINOR CHANGES: Allow for bioconductor and other repositories in the
    R environment.
  - MINOR CHANGES: Add support for pip versioning syntax.

## Changes to functionality.yaml

  - ftype has been renamed to function\_type. The value for this field
    is also being checked.
  - platform has been removed.
  - Instead, the first resource listed is expected to have `type:
    r_script`, `type: bash_script`, `type: python_script`, or `type:
    executable`. The other resources are expected to have `type: file`
    by default, and are left untouched by Viash.
  - in the arguments, field `flagValue` has been removed. Instead, use
    `type: boolean_true` and `type: boolean_false` to achieve the same
    effect.

## Changes to platform\_(docker/native).yaml

  - The `r: packages:` field has been renamed to `r: cran:`.
