[here](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## BREAKING CHANGES

  - `viash build`: Do not automatically generate a viash.yaml when
    creating an executable. Instead, you need to add the
    `-w|--write_meta` flag in order to let viash know that it should
    generate a viash.yaml in the resources dir.

## MAJOR CHANGES

  - `NXF`: Add beta functionality for running viash tests in Nextflow.

## MINOR CHANGES

  - Resources: Rework the way resources paths are converted to absolute
    URIs, should not have any impact on UX.

## BUG FIXES

  - `NXF`: Add temporary workaround for determining the used image name
    when running a component.

  - Docker Platform: Set default setup strategy to “alwayscachedbuild”
    as this used to be the default viash behaviour.

  - `NXF`: Fix issue where resource dir would not get mounted depending
    on which inputs are provided.

  - `NXF`: Accept multiple inputs when component is running as
    standalone.
