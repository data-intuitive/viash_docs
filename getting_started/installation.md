# Installation

## Supported Operating Systems

You can run viash on the following operating systems:

-   linux
-   macOS
-   Windows using [Windows Subsystem for
    Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## Prerequisites

-   viash is developed in [Scala 2.12](https://www.scala-lang.org/), so
    youâ€™ll need an [Oracle Java 8
    installation](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
    in order to use it.

## Install

### Packaged Release

To install viash, download the [latest
release](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash/releases/latest) and
save it to the `~/bin` folder or any other directory that is specified
your `$PATH` variable.

To verify your installation, run the following command:

``` bash
viash --help
```

### Build from Source

The following needs to be installed on your system in order to install
Viash:

-   GNU
    [Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html#Autotools-Introduction)
-   Java 1.8
-   `sbt`

To build and install viash, run the following commands.

``` bash
./configure --prefix=~
make
make install
viash --help
```

If you wish to install viash for all users and not just yourself, run
the following commands instead.

``` bash
./configure
make
sudo make install
viash --help
```

### Build from Source using Docker

If you have Java and Docker installed, but not `sbt`, run this instead:

``` bash
./configure --prefix=~
make docker
make install
viash --help
```
